            <div> Bates is the first Husky ever to win multiple Defensive Player of the Year awards from the Pac-12 and just the third, alongside Kristen Rivera and Danielle Lawrie, to win multiple Pac-12 Player of the Year awards of any kind.     </div>

            <h3>why is she so good? </h3>
            <!-- write a paragraph explaining why your person is so great  -->
            <p>She’s garnered national media attention for her bubbly personality, competitiveness and talent.“Softball has always been my happy place so it is pretty easy to have a good time and smile when you are having so much fun with people you love,” Sis Bates said.
              “I wish there was a meter you could measure competitiveness,” John Bates said. “She’d be off the charts. Winning means everything to her. She’d rather win instead of going 4-for-4. A bunch of their girls are wired that way.”
              Former coaches Donnie Donaldson and Mike Baisdon are not surprised to see Bates excel at such a high level.
